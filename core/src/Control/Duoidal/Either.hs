--   This is particularly useful for traversals, where you want to track _which_
--   elements of the traversal failed. E.g.,
--
-- > traverse safeHead :: t [a] -> Maybe (t a)
--
--   becomes
--
-- > traverse (noteAccum safeHead) :: t [a] -> Parallel (Either (NonEmpty a)) (t a)
noteAccum :: (Applicative f) => (a -> Maybe b) -> a -> Parallel (Either (f a)) b
noteAccum f a = Parallel . maybe (Left $ pure a) pure $ f a
